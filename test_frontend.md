# Frontend Form Submission Test Results

## Test Status: **VALIDATING FIXES**

### What We Fixed:
1. **TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')** - Added null checks for DOM elements

3. **Emergency debugging cleanup** - Removed temporary diagnostic code

### Backend Verification:
- API endpoint working correctly
- Session creation successful
- Crawler processing functional (533+ pages processed in previous tests)

### Frontend Test:
Testing form submission with https://help.hospitable.com/en/ to verify:
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Successful API call to backend
